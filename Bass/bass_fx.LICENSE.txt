What's the point?
=================
BASS_FX is an extension to the BASS audio library, providing a complete
set of DSP functions to start programming your own DJ software ;)
Programmed to enable the simple and even the advanced programmers/users to 
have in their programs some sound effects without knowing any DSP at all =)


Requirements
============
BASS 2.2 is required, the BASS_FX module will fail to load if it is not
present.


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASS_FX & BASS can be found at these websites:

        http://www.un4seen.com          (the home of BASS)
        http://www.jobnik.org
