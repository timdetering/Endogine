BASSWMA 2.2 - Copyright (c) 2002-2005 Ian Luck. All rights reserved.

What's the point?
=================
BASSWMA is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playback
of WMA files and network streams. The audio tracks of WMV files can also
be played. WMA file encoding and network broadcasting functions are also
provided.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.2 is required, the BASSWMA module will fail to load if it is not
present. The Windows Media Format modules are also required to be installed
on the user's system. They are installed with Windows Media player, so will
already be on most users' systems, but they can also be installed separately
(WMFDIST.EXE).


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASSWMA & BASS can be found at the BASS website:

        http://www.un4seen.com/
