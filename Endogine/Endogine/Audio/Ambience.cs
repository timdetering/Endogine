	/// (or a short where it IS noticeable)
	/// use this player which has a little library of effects that are randomized;
	/// e.g. a looping bg wind sound with pitch/volume which variates over time
	/// a number of bird chirps which come at irregular intervals,
	/// a few car randomized drive-by sounds etc
	/// 
	/// Possibly it should have an intensity setting, like DirectMusic has (had?)
